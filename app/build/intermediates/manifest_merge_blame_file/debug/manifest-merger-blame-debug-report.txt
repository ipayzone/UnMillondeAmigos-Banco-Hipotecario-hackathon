9   1. Definitions.
10
11      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
12      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
13
14      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
15      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
16
17      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
18      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
19      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
20      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
21      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
22      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
23      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
24
25      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
26      exercising permissions granted by this License.
27
28      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
29      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
30      source, and configuration files.
31
32      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
33      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
34      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
35      and conversions to other media types.
36
37      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
38      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
39      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
40      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
41
42      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
43      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
44      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
45      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
46      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
47      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
48      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
49
50      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
51      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
52      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
53      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
54      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
55      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
56      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
57      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
58      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
59      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
60      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
61      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
62      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
63
64      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
65      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
66      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
67
68   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
69      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
70      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
71      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
72      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
73      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
74
75   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
76      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
77      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
78      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
79      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
80      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
81      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
82      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
83      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
84      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
85      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
86      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
87      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
88      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
89      as of the date such litigation is filed.
90
91   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
92      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
93      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
94      meet the following conditions:
95
96      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
97          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
98
99      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
100          stating that You changed the files; and
101
102      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
103          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
104          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
105          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
106          the Derivative Works; and
107
108      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
109          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
110          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
111          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
112          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
113          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
114          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
115          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
116          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
117          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
118          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
119          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
120          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
121          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
122          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
123          as modifying the License.
124
125      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
126      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
127      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
128      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
129      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
130      the conditions stated in this License.
131
132   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
133      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
134      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
135      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
136      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
137      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
138      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
139
140   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
141      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
142      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
143      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
144
145   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
146      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
147      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
148      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
149      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
150      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
151      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
152      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
153      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
154
155   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
156      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
157      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
158      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
159      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
160      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
161      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
162      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
163      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
164      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
165      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
166
167   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
168      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
169      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
170      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
171      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
172      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
173      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
174      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
175      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
176      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
